This is an unofficial rework of [Fluky](http://fluky.io), with a few key
differences:

- It is more lightweight (2.5 MB vs 51KB to load the home screen).
- It focuses on a better accessibility (keyboard navigation, enhanced color
  contrast, etc.).
- It includes more modern-web features (PWA, dark theme, etc.).
- It is open-source, which means anyone can audit the code to ensure the result
  is not biased one way or the other.
